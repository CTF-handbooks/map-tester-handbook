1. Map basics
    Flags
    Unbreakable floor under flags
    Teamchests added for each team
    Indestructible barrier glass around the map (Or any other unbreakable material)
    Roof that prevents players from escaping
    Indestructible red barrier glass in the middle of the map (Indestructible red barrier stone for underground)
    Indestructible blocks at the bottom of the map
    Barriers are all placed properly
    Red barriers disappear when the math starts
    Map does not contain blocks that are not supported
    Players should be able to capture the flag
    
    **Players should not be able to escape the map and the map should work properly**

2. Team zones
    Teleports player back when crossed red barrier during build time
    Does not teleport the player back when the player did not cross the red barrier
    Red barrier covers all the empty spaces
    
    **Players should not be teleported back if they are standing within their team boundary**
    (Make sure to check all the corners of the team boundary. For example: the areas behind the team base, in the air, below in the ground, etc....)

3. Map config
    Map is enabled
    Map has a license (Recommended: CC BY-SA 4.0)
    Map has a suitable hint
    Map has initial stuff that is compatible with the map (Take notes of the terrain, the ores, etc....)
    Chest zones are added
    Team zones are set for all the existing teams

4. Balance:
    No team has a better position than the others
    No team has advantages
    The teams have about the same amount of ores and chests

   ** All teams must have an equal chance of winning**
