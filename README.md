The repository that is home to the (official or not; will decide later :P) guide to testing maps for the [Capture the Flag game by rubenwardy](https://github.com/MT-CTF/capturetheflag) on the [Mintest game engine](https://github.com/minetest/minetest). If you have any suggestions or improvements regarding this project, please make a PR or Issue for it! This handbook is possible only through the efforts of the community of Map Testers at CTF.
Maps for the Capture the Flag game are located in the [CTF Maps repository](https://github.com/mt-CTF/maps).
