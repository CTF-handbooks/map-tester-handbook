## About
CTF Map Testers have a big task on their hands. The process of testing maps involves numerous steps, and everyone has their own unique style. However, how can you get started with it? What are the requirements for it? What are the points to keep in mind while testing maps? All these questions and more will be addressed in this handbook. This handbook is **not** a rigid set of rules that Map Testers should dogmatically follow. But instead, it is a compilation of guidelines and things that Map Testers should have at their disposal for greater analytical productivity in doing their job as a tester. If you have any suggestions or improvements regarding this project, feel free to make a PR or Issue for it! This project is possible only through the efforts of the community of Map Testers at CTF.
Maps for the Capture the Flag game are located in the [CTF Maps repository](https://github.com/mt-CTF/maps).
